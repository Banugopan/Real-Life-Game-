Real Life Game
Level up in the game that really matters.  
In Real Life Game, you set 3 types of goals: short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Reaching all your short, medium, and long-term goals takes you to Level 100. The level calculation gives more weight to medium and long-term goals, so lasting progress matters more than quick wins.
